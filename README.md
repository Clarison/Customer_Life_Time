## Features

- **Data Collection**: Collects historical customer data, including purchase history, interactions, and demographic information.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creates relevant features from the collected data to train machine learning models.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizes various machine learning algorithms such as regression, survival analysis, or deep learning to predict customer lifetime.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Measures the performance of the model using metrics like RMSE, MAE, or C-index.
- **Visualization**: Visualizes the results and predictions to facilitate decision-making.
- **Integration**: Integrates the model into business systems for real-time predictions and decision support.

## Requirements

To implement this customer lifetime prediction algorithm, you will need the following:

- Python (>= 3.6)
- Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib (for data preprocessing, modeling, and visualization)
- Data source: Historical customer data (e.g., from a CRM system)
- Machine learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-survival)
- Web or application development tools (if integrating with a business system)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-lifetime-prediction.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:

   ```shell
   pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib
   ```

3. Prepare and preprocess your historical customer data for training and testing the machine learning models.

## Usage

1. **Data Collection and Preparation**:

   - Collect historical customer data, including purchase history, interactions, and demographic information.
   - Preprocess and clean the data to handle missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.

2. **Model Training**:

   - Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for customer lifetime prediction.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train the model on the training data and evaluate its performance on the testing data.

3. **Model Integration**:

   - If desired, integrate the trained model into your business systems for real-time predictions.
   - Develop APIs or interfaces to allow easy access to the model's predictions.

4. **Visualization and Reporting**:

   - Visualize the results and predictions using tools like matplotlib or a business intelligence platform.
   - Generate reports or dashboards to inform business strategies based on customer lifetime predictions.
